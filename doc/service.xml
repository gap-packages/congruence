  <Description>
    <C>InfoCongruence</C> is a special Info class for &Congruence; algorithms. 
    It has 3 levels: 0, 1 (default) and 2. To change the info level to <C>k</C>, 
    use the command <C>SetInfoLevel(InfoCongruence, k)</C>. <P/>
          
    In the example below we use this mechanism to see more details during 
    the Farey symbol construction for a congruence subgroup.

  <Func Name="CONGRUENCEBuildManual" 
         Arg=""  
        Comm="requires GAPDoc, UNIX or Linux and TeX;" />
  <Description>
    This function is used to build the manual in the following formats:
    DVI, PDF, PS, HTML and text for online help.
    We recommend that the user should have a recent and fairly
    complete &TeX; distribution.
    Since &Congruence; is distributed together with its manual,
    it is not necessary for the user to use this function. Normally
    it is intended to be used by the developers only. This is the only 
    function of &Congruence; which requires UNIX/Linux environment.

  <Func Name="CONGRUENCEBuildManualHTML" 
         Arg=""
        Comm="requires only GAPDoc" />
  <Description>
    This fuction is used to build the manual only in HTML format.
    This does not depend on the availability of the &TeX; installation
    and works under Windows and MacOS as well.
    Since &Congruence; is distributed together with its manual,
    it is not necessary for the user to use this function. Normally
    it is intended to be used by the developers only.
